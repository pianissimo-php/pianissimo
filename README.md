Welcome to the Pianissimo PHP framework, a project by [@jonmldr](https://github.com/jonmldr).
I asked myself the question: "What can Symfony do what I can't build and understand"?
And here we are. The main goal of Pianissimo is not to become a worthy PHP framework like Symfony and Laravel; frameworks where whole communities worked years on.
Similarly, the goal isn't to provide a solid solution that fits in any situation.
This project gives me the opportunity to learn and adapt code standards, techniques and (design) patterns.
Feedback is always welcome!
