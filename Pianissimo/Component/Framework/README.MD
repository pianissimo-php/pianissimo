## The Framework Component
The Framework Component 'glues' all components together into a framework.

##### WARNING: this component is in development and unstable to use.

### Core
It is common to use a Core class located in `src/Core.php` which extends `Pianissimo\Component\Framework\Core`.
This allows you to configure the Core to the requirements of the project.

#### Container
The Container is booted in the `handle()` method.
When the container is booted, the container is initialized and built.

The container is an instance of the `ContainerBuilder` class.
A container loader, an instance of a `Pianissimo\Component\Config\DelegatingLoader` is used to load the service definitions.
The `services.yaml` file of the Framework component is loaded by the `DelegatingLoader`.
If the `configureContainer()` method exists in the projects' Core class, it is called with the `DelegatingLoader` as an argument. 
In this way one or more configuration files with service definitions can be loaded via the `configureContainer()` method by adding them to the `DelegatingLoader`.
